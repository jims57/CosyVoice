if torch.cuda.is_available() is False and (load_jit is True or load_trt is True or fp16 is True):
    load_jit, load_trt, fp16 = False, False, False

Let me explain each parameter and when you should use them:
load_jit (JIT = Just In Time compilation):
When set to True, it loads optimized JIT-compiled versions of certain model components (text encoder, LLM, and flow encoder)
JIT compilation can improve inference speed by optimizing the model execution path
You should set this to True when:
You're running inference on GPU
You want better performance/speed
You don't need model flexibility (JIT models are less flexible for modifications)
load_trt (TRT = TensorRT):
When True, it loads TensorRT-optimized versions of the flow decoder/estimator
TensorRT is NVIDIA's deep learning inference optimizer that can significantly improve performance
You should set this to True when:
You're running on NVIDIA GPU
Maximum inference speed is critical
You're doing production deployment
You have TensorRT properly installed
fp16 (16-bit floating point):
When True, the model runs in half-precision (FP16) instead of full precision (FP32)
FP16 reduces memory usage and can improve speed, with a small potential cost to accuracy
You should set this to True when:
You're running on modern NVIDIA GPU (Volta architecture or newer)
You want to reduce memory usage
You need faster inference and can accept slight precision loss
You're using either load_jit or load_trt


Important notes from the code:
if torch.cuda.is_available() is False and (load_jit is True or load_trt is True or fp16 is True):
    load_jit, load_trt, fp16 = False, False, False
    logging.warning('no cuda device, set load_jit/load_trt/fp16 to False')

- All these optimizations require CUDA/GPU
The code automatically disables these features if no CUDA device is available
Recommended configurations:
For development/testing:
cosyvoice = CosyVoice2('model_dir', load_jit=False, load_trt=False, fp16=False)

For basic production with GPU:
cosyvoice = CosyVoice2('model_dir', load_jit=True, load_trt=True, fp16=True)

For maximum performance in production:
cosyvoice = CosyVoice2('model_dir', load_jit=True, load_trt=True, fp16=True)
